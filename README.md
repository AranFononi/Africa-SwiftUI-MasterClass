# SwiftUI Multi-Feature App 📱🧩  

### Exploring SwiftUI with Real-World Features  

This project is built during Chapter 13 of the SwiftUI Masterclass. It brings together several key iOS development skills into one app — from working with JSON to building grid layouts, using MapKit, video playback, and even launching the app on macOS with Catalyst.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The app is made to show how different Swift and SwiftUI features can come together in a clean, working project. It covers topics like building layouts, working with APIs, integrating maps, adding stickers, and using extensions and generics.
